Brad Johansen is a sales and technology professional based in Houston, TX. He works for [Refinitiv](http://refinitiv.com) and is learning about income share agreements for [PPL VC](https://ppl.vc).

At Refinitiv, I am a customer success manager responsible for our strategic relationships in the oil and gas industry. In addition to my work at Refinitiv, I am the organizer of Effective Altruism Houston where I aim to inspire others to be more effective in their giving and in their careers.

The purpose of this website is to test my knowledge and put it out there for you to judge. Connect with me on Twitter here.
